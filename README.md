⚠️ Datapacks are stored in the overworld folder, if you want to use the nether or end you will need to use the overworld! It is strongly recommended not to import other maps and to only use these 3

These maps took a long time to generate and used a lot of resources, so if you want to support me you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/5im0n) ☕
